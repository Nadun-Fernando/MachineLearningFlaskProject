Qunisha Roberson, 5 stars ,"I went to Ramsay kitchen in Las Vegas during spring break 2023. As a big fan of chief Ramsey I had to go to one of his many restaurants, Ramsey kitchen is new and available seating.  I had the 3 course meal special and it was delicious and it was a great way to trying Chief Ramsey signature dishes. The Cesar salad was great potion size and the Toffee dessert. The beef wellington was so good I wished I had more. The staff are wonderful and really great with my three boys. Overall a great experience.",7 hours ago
Ahmad Ahmadian, 2 stars ,"I recently visited this place in Las Vegas that offered Gordon Ramsey's recipes, and unfortunately, my experience fell short of my expectations.

I started with the onion soup, which was disappointing due to the uncured meat taste. It had an odd flavor that detracted from the dish. Moreover, I was taken aback to find meat in the soup, which was unexpected and not something I had encountered in onion soup before.

For my main course, I ordered the chicken breasts, which were unfortunately undercooked and lacking in flavor. They were bland and lacking in seasoning, and the undercooked chicken was a major letdown. The flatbreads pork belly was an additional extra, and it was decent but not extraordinary.

On the plus side, the service and vibe were professional, and the waiters were friendly and accommodating. However, the quality of the food fell short of what I had hoped for.

Overall, while I had high expectations for this kitchen that offers Gordon Ramsey's recipes, my experience was unfortunately disappointing. The undercooked and bland chicken breasts and the uncured meat taste of the onion soup left much to be desired. While the service and vibe were pleasant, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant based on my experience.",2 days ago
Helene K, 5 stars ,"Located in Harrahs and beautifully decorated restaurant. Absolutely lovely interior and ambiance.  Sat in the back near the kitchen.

Food: Highly recommend the Boston's Inferno cocktail.  Was smoked infused and absolutely smooth going down. Legitimately the best bourbon drink I've had to date. Friend had the spiced pear which is just fun. Recommend that one too.

We tried an assortment of appetizers.
Crab cake
Tuna Tartare
Shrimp Cocktail
French Onion Soup

Enjoyed the Tuna Tartare the best, next to the shrimp cocktail.

I had the scallops and my friends had the beef Wellington. Scallops were cooked perfectly. Would recommend, if not having the red meat options. Dessert was the English Toffee Pudding which wasn't as sweet as it sounds which was lovely but the Eton mess was a bit more delicious.

Service was immaculate.  All the servers were so nice and very accommodating and we shut the place down and didn't feel rushed or like we were being a nuisance for eating later. They genuinely were all kind and just great at their jobs.

Would highly recommend the restaurant and all the staff. Looking forward to my next visit and another Boston's Inferno. üòä",2 days ago
Emily HR, 5 stars ,Stopped in for lunch the day day after our amazing dinner. It was quiet and we sat right in front of the service line. An amazing experience. Lobster roll was wonderful and perfect portion for midday. The staff was very friendly and gleefully divulged the famous name sakes impromptu appearances. It will definitely be a repeat dining venue!,6 days ago
Megan Martin, 5 stars ,"My first Gordon Ramsay restraunt experience and hands down I was BLOWN AWAY! My mom and I split the ""lump crab cake"" and the ""filet mignon"". The crab cake was divine, no fillers just all straight crab meat! It was tender, fell apart when cutting a piece with a fork and has now taken spot as my #1 Crab Cake EVER! The filet was cooked to perfection, tender, juicy and melted in my mouth like butter! Beautiful execution and presentation overall! I will ABSOLUTLEY be back and I can't wait to try more of the menu! The service was also impeccable!",a week ago
Enrique Monta√±o, 4 stars ,"After the disappointment of the hamburgers we decided to give another chance to the restaurants of the famous Chef that we found by chance looking for dinner. It is located inside the Harrah's Hotel and Casino.
We really liked the food here. The Caesar salad is large, it can be shared between 2 people.
The delicious salmon and the dessert, pudding, a delight. I just don't recommend the risotto, which is very simple and I've had much better in Mexico.",a week ago

Griffen Stapp, 5 stars ,"An amazing experience of delicious drinks and food that will leave you wanting more.
We found this place on the way out of Vegas, and had to try it mainly cause it had ramsays name on it!
We got there during lunch time and it was empty as it had just opened. They are even opening for breakfast soon which would be a delight.
The service was great, with only one other group they checked on us the entire time.
We ordered a couple drink recommendations and then moved onto the main courses. We even got a beef carpaccio appetizer.   The food was all modestly priced, and was delicious for every bite.
Highly recommend checking this place out on your neck trip to Vegas!
Their selection of food is delicious, hand picked for the day and restaurant season, and we‚Äôll worth it!",a week ago

Our waitress was wonderful, & the decor is beautiful, but the food was terrible.

The only thing we enjoyed was the toffee pudding.

Sarah James, 1 star ,"Beautiful restaurant and the food was good but our overall experience was terrible. After calling to confirm it was the same menu as Hell‚Äôs Kitchen and waiting 30 minutes to be seated (with reservation), we were told there was no vegan options. We asked the manager what could be made vegan and he disappeared for 20 minutes and we had to ask again to be given an answer. The answer: asparagus and plain risotto.
Truly a real bummer given there‚Äôs a whole separate vegan/veg menu at Hell‚Äôs Kitchen. Also $30 for plain risotto? Hard pass.",2 weeks ago
Alexis Rivera, 5 stars ,"My husband and I dined at Ramsay's Kitchen at Harrah's in Las Vegas. We've been to Gordon Ramsay Burger and Gordon Ramsay Steak, and now here. To say the food and service was amazing is honestly an understatement. The staff was very attentive, respectful, friendly, and dressed 11 out of 10. Not once did our glasses go below half. When my steak wasn't medium well when I received it, the chef appeared out of nowhere, I swear! I assume he caught my slight facial expression when I realized the temp of the steak was off. He offered  for it to be redone, and I accepted. The waitress and her assistant had come to our table separately, asking if everything was okay. Then the Ma√Ætre D' came to our table and said dessert was on them. I was definitely not worried about the steak, but they wanted to correct it anyway they could. I've never seen this type of service, and it was phenomenal. I do feel bad for the uproar with the staff since it obviously got to the Ma√Ætre D'. :( I wish I could thank Gordon Ramsay personally for his exceptional standards at his restaurants. It's worth every penny each time we go. From the time we enter, to the time we leave, we're highly impressed. Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è",2 weeks ago

Rhonda Mitchell (Rhonda), 5 stars ,"Update: I was contacted by the manager Joe after our first experience at this restaurant. Our first experience wasn‚Äôt the best so Joe did an AMAZING job making it right! He remained professionally, understanding and accommodating. We arrived at the restaurant at 7PM for our reservation and was seated immediately inspite what seemed to be a busy and crowded night. We had great seating by the kitchen and I enjoyed watching the staff work. The kitchen staff seemed like a well oiled machine. They even had this thing where the called out the table numbers they were working on in harmony. Lol Maria our waitress was pleasant and personable. Our food was DELICIOUS. The only thing that could have topped this experience is if Ramsay himself showed up. Everything was perfect. Thanks again Joe for taking care of us and making our second experience the best one yet. I look forward to dining here again and I can‚Äôt wait to visit Hell‚Äôs Kitchen Chicago.",2 weeks ago
Jordan Black, 5 stars ,"What can I say aside from it's exceptional. Such a nice retreat form the hustle of the strip. Gordon and his team havereally outdone themselves. The Wellington definitely lives up to its reputation, the crab cake has to be one of the best I've ever had. Kelsey is such a gem of a server, and all the staff are some of the best in the industry. When the word gets out about this place, the reservation books will always be full! Thanks to everyone for such a wonderful dining experience. As a fellow restaurant industry member I'm pretty judgemental and not picky on small stuff. Not enough to complain, but enough to silently judge. I had absolutely nothing to nit pick. Truly a special place. It has the vibe of a stand alone restaurant in the fancy part of any city.",3 weeks ago

Pim Kang, 4 stars ,"Great food at a high price. I highly recommend that you have a reservation before showing up at least on a weekend. We liked our food enough but not too impressed with the service. We waited more than half an hour to get our bill just to get a wrong bill. Then, we waited at least 15 more minutes to get the correct bill and then waited some more to pay.

Alissa Jones, 3 stars ,"My husband and I had a 8:30 dinner reservation last night. When we arrived, my husband had checked in with the front desk hostess and we‚Äôre told that we‚Äôd be seated shortly. We had waited for about 45 min before we were seated because they had actually forgotten about us (we were standing in plain sight near the entrance). In that time, we saw other parties get seated who showed up later than us. In that same timeframe, a hostess approached us twice to confirm the name the reservation was under. About 30 min in, my husband had to go to the front desk hostess again to ask what happened and they had indeed forgot us and had to scramble to find a table.

The food we waited for was this place‚Äôs saving grace - the bartenders and kitchen did an amazing job with our drinks and our entrees. We loved the beef Wellington and the sticky toffee dessert. Just know that it weren‚Äôt for the Ramsay‚Äôs overall reputation, we probably would‚Äôve left.",a month ago

The d√©cor is modern, the lighting is excellent, the staff is attentive but not overbearing AND, most importantly, the food is amazing.  We had to go back two days later to try other dishes.  I had Beef Wellington - awesome. My wife had the rib-eye with shrimp, also awesome.  On our second visit we had the crispy skin salmon - done to perfection and me, Beef Wellington - again. Can't get that dish, so perfectly done in other places. It definitely is not (""it's f_______ raw"").  Also recommend the beet salad appetizer.  The manager (Yasmini) is really on top of things, ensuring total customer satisfaction. His desert recommendation, Sticky Toffee Pudding and an espresso, hit the spot perfectly to end an awesome night out. I appreciate professionalism and awesome customer service. Thank you.",a month ago

Josh O'Bannon, 5 stars ,"What an amazing experience!  From cocktails to appitzers through the main course to desert, everything was SPOT ON!  I cannot suggest anything to make it better.  Everything was cooked perfectly!  The French onion soup was unbelievable, the beef carpaccio was decadent, steaks were cooked perfect all the way through, the sides were flavorful, the deserts were not too sweet and amazing!  I will admit that I watch Hell‚Äôs Kitchen EVERY MORNING when I wake up.  But I tried to not let that play into my experience.  In all honesty, I was probably more aware and critical than if I had not watched the show.  It met every expectation and some.  I don‚Äôt think I have had a better experience in some time.  And I was at the Golden Steer and triple George the last two nights, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm comparing this to In-N-Out!  The wine list was well put together, cocktails were spot on, just overall the best I‚Äôve had in a long time!  ‚ÄòContent‚Äô with this years Vegas trip is an understatement‚Ä¶. We‚Äôll done Gordon Ramsey, well done.  And cheers to Autum, our waitress, she was solid.  She knows the menu, has a great personality and is clearly a seasoned professional.  I wish there was something I could criticize, but I‚Äôm coming up short trying to find something‚Ä¶. Ok, the only think I can think of is the fact that it pretty much died down by 9:30PM.  It would have been so fun to see the music get louder and another crowd come in for the late shift!  I know, I get it, that‚Äôs not your intent.  Thank you, Gordon.",a month ago

Peter McCumber, 5 stars ,"First time here.  I eat at several high end restaurants at home, so I was interested in seeing how the man, the myth, the legend, the franchise stacked up.  After all, I‚Äôve been watching him on TV for a decade.  Let‚Äôs see how it goes.  We were greeted by the hostess and sat promptly in a quiet well lit corner booth.  Hostess and server were both very friendly, prompt and professional.  I ordered a crab cake appetizer and shrimp cocktail.  My wife ordered Caesar Salad.  With my entire family coming from Maryland, it only seemed natural to I own a crab cake empire making hundreds of thousands  of crab cakes.  So of course I was a certain Gordon‚Äôs crab cake wouldn‚Äôt measure up.  I was hoping for an 8 on a scale of 1-10.

The crab cake came first and for the first time in my life, I found a crab cake better than my family‚Äôs recipe.  The consistency, texture and flavor weren‚Äôt much different than mine, but somehow Ramsey was able to source much larger lump meat than I had.  Of course, neither of ours showed any filler whatsoever, but the quality and size of the lump meat was clearly the difference.  And I thought I bought the best meat.

The presentation of the shrimp cocktail was nice.  The shrimp were large but very tough and had almost no flavor.  You can‚Äôt win them all, I guess.

I bought the Filet Mignon.  I‚Äôm usually a New York Strip guy, but the restaurant had run out of those.  I ordered the filet medium.

The food came in record time.  To be fair, the place wasn‚Äôt terribly busy, but I suspect that the staff are used to operating with an efficiency that keeps things moving quickly.  The steak looked perfect.

The flavor was fantastic and the meat was as tender as any cut of beef I‚Äôve ever had.  It didn‚Äôt indicate it on the menu but I was fairly certain the cut was Choice and not Prime, even still, it was cooked to absolute perfection and tender and as flavorful as you could imagine.  For $55, I think it is the deal of the century for a Filet Mignon.

I asked the server if she knew the quality of cut.  I was shocked that she immediately knew that it was a choice cut of meat.  She stated that they were moving to prime cuts of meat when supply issues were resolved.  I CAN‚ÄôT WAIT TO SEE what they can do with prime, based on what they did with choice.

Chelsea was the perfect server.  She was the perfect blend of attentive but not intrusive.  She answered every question quickly and accurately.  She even tried to resolve the shrimp cocktail issue, but I wouldn‚Äôt let her.  I never ran out of drink and never lacked for anything.  I wish she could be my server every restaurant I eat at.

All in all, a pretty fantastic experience.  If you go, ask for Chelsea.  Tip big.  She‚Äôs worth it.",a month ago
Renee G, 5 stars ,"Staff was attentive and I always had my water glass filled, the food came out in a timely manner. The food was delicious. I would stay away from the mac and cheese and stear towards the seafood. You can get his famed Wellington and a lot of locations so we opted not to get this as well.

shravya shashidhar, 1 star ,"King crab starter was pretty good. The liquid inside the shell was kept intact which added to the flavor. Next we ordered Butternut squash risotto one with egg and other with chicken. It tasted a lot like the US variant of Indian dish Khichdi. Dint have any flavor and was just bland. The chicken was rubbery and had absolutely no taste. The roasted chicken breast which we ordered was the last attempt to not be disappointed at this place, however it turned out to be the worst dish among the three. Outer layer of the chicken was roasted with absolutely no flavor within. Desserts were ok too.",2 months ago

Steff A., 5 stars ,"Party of 6 for my friend's birthday dinner made for a great experience at Ramsay's Kitchen.

The dining area is gorgeous with contemporary decor and creative lighting options. There's a full service bar which was also packed during our Saturday evening visit.  Our server was on point with going through the menu and the specials for the evening.  We never had to look for him once as he was around frequently to check on us.

French Onion Soup - This was the most flavorful French Onion soup I've had in a bit.  I love how the bread, cheese and beef arrives planked on top of the bowl, ready for you to drop it in.  Very savory, cheesy and a perfect start if you're looking for soup.
Seafood Tower - You know what these are about.  Every sea item on here was fresh.
24 Ounce Bone In Ribeye - Medium Rare is my thing and the Kitchen cooked it perfectly for me.  Red, juicy and delish

All the side dishes were good to go...
asparagus
mushrooms
broccolini

Eton Mess - This was my first Eton Mess and it was great.  Strawberries, berries, whipped cream and some kind of meringue makes for a sweet (not too sweet) dessert.  It's light which was perfect right after i took down my 24 oz. ribeye. lol

Overall, this might be my current favorite Ramsay restaurant.  I will definitely recommend and visit again soon.  Cheers!",2 months ago

Paula Staver, 3 stars ,"Dinner reservation for 2 birthday celebrations on a Wednesday evening. Restaurant is easy to access from the parking garage.
We were greeted right away and sat within a couple minutes. The restaurant was about half full.
Very pretty decor but the restaurant is loud and hard to have a conversation.
For starters we had the crab cake, which was delicious, shrimp cocktail, which was also very good, onion soup which was also good and the beet salad. The dressing on the beet salad was VERY heavy on horseradish- that was all you tasted. I wouldn‚Äôt order it again.
Mains were salmon, ribeye, beef Wellington and oysters. Rib-eye was basic. Bernaise sauce had to be returned as it was cold. Beef Wellington was insanely tender but also served less than lukewarm. Purred potatoes were amazing. Carrots were still rock hard and cold. Broccolini had to be returned as it was very cold. It was returned to the table after all eating was completed so they comp‚Äôd the item.
Since we were celebrating birthdays, they brought out two stinky toffee puddings which were delicious.
If I were to return, I‚Äôd wait some time as they are still pretty new, and I‚Äôd order the crab cake and sticky toffee pudding.",2 months ago

Jack D, 3 stars ,"Went for New Years Weekend....I have been waiting so long to go to one of Ramsay's restaurants and I must say I was a bit let down, especially since I went to another high-end, not publicly well-known restaurant the night before (which was much better). Food was decent, but nothing special except the potato puree which was excellent... and the drinks?! A total rip off! I spend $19 on a small margarita that had one giant ice cube that took up most of the small glass, leaving me with very little to drink. I may have ranked it 4 stars if it weren't for the size of my drink. We didn't even bother with dessert. Crabcake was not my fav, I've had way better elsewhere and I ended up removing the entire outer portion of my Beef Wellington as it was not very flaky on the outside more mushy than anything and just ate the filet by itself. Plus, when reserving I indicated it was for a birthday and they sat us at a small table in a dark corner right by the front door of the casino with a giant pillar next to us, (not the best spot for a table), you could smell the smoke coming from the casino. The waiter and his assistant were good though :-)",2 months ago

Robert Mitchener, 5 stars ,"This is a diamond in the rough of fantastic bars when it comes to Vegas. After trekking up and down the strip it's difficult to find a place that has a good cocktail menu, has an acceptable liquor selection, and will make off menu cocktails.

I actually came here when they first opened and then returned again a couple months later to compare. John the bartender is fantastic and on point, he even remembered me from between the visits. All the staff are just as friendly as before and the drinks and food are just as well prepared.

The first time I came here I got the small seafood Tower and the shrimp cocktail. All the seafood was fresh and delicious, the platter came with crab, muscles, oysters, shrimp, and lobster.

I also got a variety of drinks all made very well including the: Witch's Elixir, The Spiced Pear, 90 Degrees in the Shade, and the Strawberry Chocolate Negroni.

They'll tell you the petal is edible on the Witch's Elixir, and it is, but it is very bitter.

Mrs. P girl, 3 stars ,"This was our first time here since they closed the oyster bar. I would prefer the oyster bar over Ramsay's kitchen.  The oysters are ridiculously over priced not to mention the wine is $22 for a glass of wine that you can get at any local grocery store at the same price for the bottle and the good wine is even more expensive. I had the beef wellington, and it was ok. I've had better. The asparagus was flavorless. They don't have any A1 sauce, and they want you to purchase their flavorless steak house made sauces. The onion soup had no flavor until I pust salt in it, which made it much better. The mac and cheese wasn't worth it. My son and my husband said mine is a hundred tumes better. The server was very knowledgeable about the menu.They don't allow you to bring outside drinks in. You have to finish your drink before being seated, so you know they want you to purchase their overpriced drinks. This restaurant doesn't fit in at the Harrah's at all. The steaks were priced about the same as any other steak house. We come to Harrah's at least once a month, if not more, during football season.  We will stick with Cut in the Venetian for our oysters and steaks from here on out. The one thing we loved was the crab cakes they were filled with big pieces of delicious crab. The way they talked this restaurant up, I guess I was just expecting more.",2 months ago
David Schiller, 5 stars ,"Surprisingly good restaurant to be in Harrah's.  Its new, so they are still working out the kinks (especially the front bar before being seated,  where there were so many workers but they seemed to all be in training mode).  Once seated however, the setting and and overall experience was great. Food was consistently great for all three diners, from the starters to the main courses to the desert. Wait staff were good (especially the ""assistant???"" Amir!) So friendly and made it a great evening.  Crab Cake was full of crab, not fillers; onion soup was so flavorful and NOT just all onions like everyone else does; Bone in ribeye prepared more grilled than charred, which was a nice change from every other place in Vegas; the filet was perfect and the Beef Wellington made it a triple play!.  Sticky Toffee Pudding, say no more.  Will definitely head back next visit.",2 months ago
Jianian Lin, 5 stars ,"Very excellent food. With pretty nice service.

I ordered the pure crab cake and scallop as the waitress suggested. Also ordered a  bone in ribeye to fill my stomach. All these food has gorgeous arrangement. The green onion, citrus have wonderfully balanced the taste. Demi glace on the ribeye is provide more flavor to the beaf with a taste of red wine. Pork belly with scallop both are soft and umami. I am looking forward to visit Gordon's restaurant again!",2 months ago

Sunny Soto, 5 stars ,"Wow wow wow!! Ramsay's Kitchen has only been open about 6 weeks and they are already executing an experience I know chef Ramsay would be proud of. I work in the restaurant industry and I love to treat myself on vacation to a great dining experience, this did not disappoint!
I didn't have a reservation but the host didn't make me feel bad about it, she got me a great table in the bar area. I was able to watch the football game on as well, which was a great option since my team was playing. Hope, the hostess noticed my Raider hat and made sure I had a front row seat to watch the game while eating. My server, Jahir and his server assistant were so amazing. Jahir walked me through the menu and they both suggested their fave dishes. The bartender even made me a couple different delicious mocktails since I mentioned I didn't drink. I took a couple suggestions from the guys and ordered a grape Flatbread with blue cheese and balsamic. It was delicious and crispy. I had the roasted chicken on polenta and a side of Mac & cheese for my main courses. I must say I don't like Mac & cheese normally but this was absolutely divine! The pasta was perfectly cooked the combo of cheeses was rich and indulgent but supper flavorful. The chicken was moist and tender, the vegetables that came with it could have been more tender though. I saved room for dessert and had the Eton mess. It was fresh, vibrant, and absolutely delicious! The mirengue was melt in your mouth delicious! The kitchen is killing it. The staff was so on point I still can't believe they are only 6 weeks in, congrats to you all on a great opening!",2 months ago
Mike Cheng, 5 stars ,"We were there at Ramsey's kitchen last night celebrating my daughter's 18th birthday while vacationing in Las Vegas for Christmas.  Also, we are here to see if Gordon Ramsey's restaurant are worth the hype. Well, behold, it was worth the hype, and the service was impeccable.  I had watched just a few videos prior to going to see what dishes are worth trying, and ended up getting the lump crab cakes, King crab leg and 1/2 dozen oysters on a half shell for appetizers.  Definitely amazing and delicious.  Then for entr√©es, we ordered Crispy skin Salmon, Pan Speared Scallops, and a 24 oz bone-in Ribeye.  They were unbelievable.  However, the ribeye was not as tender as I had expected even though I had ordered medium rare.  So, perhaps it's the type of beef or it wasn't aged that it was chewy.  Then we had an incredible potatoes puree that was silky smooth and Mac and Cheese to share.  Finally, we ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding and Eton's Mess, which both were absolutely amazing.  In fact, I believe the dessert was the highlight of the meal, but everything else was definitely worth the money and experience.  Reservation is a must, and I'd would at least book a month ahead.  Overall, highly recommended!",2 months ago
Penny Erickson, 5 stars ,"100% Recommended! We looked at the menu before arriving so knew exactly what to order. Two appetizers, two entrees, two desserts and one cocktail came out to just over $200. I find that MORE than reasonable for the wonderful taste experience we had. Everything was fresh and delicious. The ONLY thing wrong is it‚Äôs in Vegas and I‚Äôm not anymore. I want to go back. I cannot end this review without mentioning the staff. They were as much a part of the experience as the meal and just as great!",2 months ago
Andre, 5 stars ,"We went here for our Christmas dinner. We were there 15 minutes before our reserved time and were kindly directed to the bar where we drank a delicious cocktail.
Our table was ready at the time reserved.
We had the king crab for starters. Sharing the starter was not a problem. The appetizer was delicious.
For mains we had the Filet Mignon and the Beef Wellington. The two main courses tasted excellent and were perfectly prepared.
The dessert was also very tasty.
The staff was nice and helpful.
The restaurant itself is stylishly furnished, but you have to go from the restaurant to the casino to get to the toilet.
We had a great evening at Ramsay's Kitchen!",2 months ago
Nick D, 5 stars ,This place was amazing the decor was very nice for a kitchen in a hotel by Gordon. The service was the best everyone was so nice and enjoyed working there especially my waiter names Jeff who was very helpfull and nice. Lastly the food is worth every penny has items from the actual hells kitchen such as the wellington and filet mingnon that we got which were so good even in medium rare which we dont really get.

Bench Press Betty, 5 stars ,"My fianc√© and I were looking for a romantic restaurant to celebrate the debut of my new small business at the Olympia Expo and we learned about Ramsay‚Äôs new restaurant in Harrahs!

Tucked away in a quiet corner, it has a very classy and intimate feel. The staff were very warm and welcoming. We hadn‚Äôt made a reservation ahead, but we‚Äôre able to sit in the lounge area of the bar. It was very roomy and comfortable.

Their beverage menu was extensive, and so enticing it was hard to decide! I noticed several patrons at the bar sipping the Prestige Martini, and never having had a classic gin martini, I decided to give it a try! It was delicious with just enough lemon zest to balance the gin. They‚Äôd sprinkled some sprigs of saffron in it which tasted great, but I later learned it does stain your teeth‚Ä¶might not want to include that if you have pearly whites.

I‚Äôd always wanted to try Beef Wellington! When it came to our table, I was in awe! The crust was cooked perfectly crisp. I‚Äôd ordered it medium, and it was cooked just right. The potato pur√©e was a nice balance to the flavors of the Wellington. I wish I could have requested some additional red wine demi-glace. It was so rich and delicious!

My fianc√© got a filet mignon and it was just the right portion. They offer toppings, but he enjoyed just eating it without. We also split a family style portion of creamy mac & cheese.

I only wish we‚Äôd had enough room left to try their savory sweet desserts! Gordon Ramsey features a recipe he learned from his mother for sticky toffee pudding and it was the talk of the town! Perhaps next time we visit, we‚Äôll drop by JUST for drinks and dessert!

It was the perfect ending to a wonderful weekend that will hopefully open many doors and opportunities for my new growing small business!",3 months ago

Gregory Pappas, 3 stars ,"We wanted to be impressed with Ramsay's new restaurant. First impression is not great as it's right off the casino floor, and not a particularly upscale casino in the least. Wife's birthday so we had noted such on the reservation which was acknowledged. Nonetheless we got seated in terribly uncomfortable chairs and table just next to the bar and barely in from the casino floor. They accommodated our polite request to move gladly, but my wife noticed the server whose section we moved to roll her eyes when told of our move request. That is tough to overlook. However service was fine with a smile. In general the service 'warmth' seemed contrived and scripted. Prices are aligned with this type of restaurant in Vegas...meaning overpriced. Wine selection was so disappointing, minimal options by the glass. It was similar selection to more casual restaurants, nothing particularly interesting. I asked if they had a zinfandel by chance despite not being on the list. Typically in fine dining restaurants they will check with the sommelier (which I don't think they have) or the bartender and consider opening a bottle. I was shot down with just a comment that they don't have zin by the glass. Okay fine. We shared a mixed green salad to start. Very bitter from the excessive kale, little creativity and the dressing wasn't balanced to my taste. Then we shared a crab cake and the signature beef Wellington. Crab cake was phenomenal. Pure lump and jumbo lump meat with no filler. A top 3 I've ever eaten. The beef was fine. Cooked properly, but lacked a punch of flavor. It was simply okay, and not worth the price to us. I certainly wouldn't go back except for the crab cake possibly. Perhaps we are spoiled by the amazing quality and value of so many restaurants in our foodie city of Houston. I always feel a bit disappointed with Vegas fine dining and this was no exception.",3 months ago

Joshua Hughes, 1 star ,"Worst food in Vegas to date.

Came for dinner, got seated behind a pole. Ordered crab cake, salmon, and Mac and cheese.

First salmon came out raw and cold. Second one wasn‚Äôt much better but at least edible. Rest of the food was just ok.

Manager, I assume, brought the second one and said he would comp the meal. But then got the check for everything including 2 salmons.

They took the second one off but still way too much for the lackluster meal and service. Standards at his other restaurants set the bar too high for this one.

Will not return most likely.",3 months ago
Darren Ursua, 5 stars ,"We decided to eat here for my friend‚Äôs last stay for the night in Vegas. I Didn't know there was Ramsay‚Äôs kitchen at Harrah's.

Kassi Zorzan, 5 stars ,"I can‚Äôt even. This was our first Gordon Ramsay restaurant- and it was also a last minute find. We didn‚Äôt even realize it‚Äôs only been open a month.

HOLY COW was it amazing. Gordon Ramsay- you know where it‚Äôs at!

Ambiance and decor were amazing. Our waitress was SO good and so much fun. She was awesome.

The food though- absolutely spectacular. Everything. 2 appetizers, 1 side, 3 dishes for 3 people, and 2 dessert. All amazing. Both my husband and I actually thought it was better than the Michelin restaurant we went to on the strip.

William Moloney, 3 stars ,"The staff was friendly, polite, and helpful.

The food here was mediocre at best - on par with what you get at an Applebee's or Fridays. I had the butternut squash risotto (listed as a signature dish).  The risotto was greasy and heavy.
Everything is served a la carte, so we ordered and shared all of the sides available on the menu. The asparagus was so undercooked that it was too tough to eat and went to waste; the potato puree  had so much crema in them that they didn't even taste like potatoes; the broccoli was decent but nothing special- basically what you would expect from a big box chain restaurant; the mushrooms were good; the mac and cheese was overdone and tasted like it came from a box. In the end, most of the sides were so mediocre that they went unfinished. The only saving grace of the whole meal was the sticky toffee pudding dessert - which was very good. The dessert drove this rating up a star. Without dessert, I would have given 2 stars.

I came with higher expectations given how picky Gordon is, but I left disappointed and wondering - what if Gordon himself was served food like this?",3 months ago
Roger Leek, 4 stars ,"I wish I could give five stars, but my Beef Wellington was mushy and only lukewarm. My table mates said I should send it back, but honestly there is some level of intimidation at the thought of sending back Ramsay's signature dish. Otherwise our experience was pretty good. The restaurant wasn't too busy, so our waiter was very suggestive, to the point of annoyance at times and seemed visibly disappointed if we didn't order something he suggested. He also wouldn't tell us the price of the special when we asked. Overall, I'd probably go again and not get the Wellington.",3 months ago
Dave Hoder, 3 stars ,"We were there the first Saturday they were open, and I expected better - It seems Gordon Ramsay is just selling his name since he wasn't even there to oversee the opening of his own restaurant. I‚Äôve been a line cook at the opening of a new restaurant and know it takes a bit of time for everyone to find their rhythm but no one in the kitchen seemed to be in charge.

For a starter we ordered a simple flatbread and it took an hour to arrive (we had an early 6:15 reservation and the restaurant wasn‚Äôt even half full yet). When it finally came it tasted good but was greasy and soggy.

I had Beef Wellington for the first time and the pastry was thin and soggy. It looked good but I expected something similar to a pot pie crust with some bite to it.

My wife had the Salmon and while it was perfectly cooked, the texture was mushy instead of flakey (like maybe it was pre-cooked in a Sous Vide). I‚Äôm from the Pacific Northwest and know the taste and texture of good salmon.

The staff was great and didn‚Äôt charge us for the late starter and even gave us complimentary deserts since we were there over 2 hours.

Hey Gordon: Put on some makeup so they don‚Äôt recognize you and go critique your own restaurant üòä",3 months ago
Brandon M, 3 stars ,"I'm at a loss here. I really wanted to like this, as I've been a huge Ramsay fan for years, been to every 1 of his places both in vegas and to the la hk. This place is missing some magic. It was very drab and almost empty for an opening weekend(11/19/22) Felt like an old forgotten second restaurant that everyone left in the past. Had a dramatic uprising argument break out on the floor and the place still felt stodgy. Its clear that they were going for a low key lounge type of place, a complete removal from the extravagant fancy environment of usual Ramsay locales. Friendly staff, pretty quick food turnaround and though I've always felt every restaurant uses way too much salt (and this place is absolutely no exception) myself and my girlfriend did enjoy the dinner. But next time I'll be going back to a mainstay. Just not the fine dining experience I go out for here. Not a total negative time, just not what I would have hoped for.",3 months ago
Bri M, 5 stars ,"Amazing restaurant! Went on the official opening day 11/25 (it was in a soft launch for a couple weeks). Ordered a couple cocktails, the oysters, salmon (it's supposed to be cooked medium rare, per the waiter), and the toffee pudding. Everything was so delicious, plated beautifully, and we had a wonderful waiter!! I loved the ambience and the attention to detail when it came to serving us. Wait time felt like nothing. Everything was impressive.

I will be definitely be coming back and telling everyone about this place. I loved Hell's Kitchen, but this will definitely be my new spot. It's worth every penny. ****I'm also in the food industry as a GM ;)",3 months ago

Chris Williams, 5 stars ,"The staff are spectacular. Dana was utterly amazing. I would return simply because of her attentiveness and friendly demeanor.

Bathrooms are outside the restaurant at this time and that is a little annoying. It seems they are still being worked on though so should be available soon.

Cocktails and the bar staff themselves are great.

Food was generally very very good. My steak was over done but they offered to fix it right away. I am not one to waste a cut of steak so I ate mine and it was still good. The manager came over as I was finishing and he offered to prepare another steak for me. That was appreciated but not necessary.
The sticky toffee pudding, is different from Hell's Kitchen but is equally as delicious.
