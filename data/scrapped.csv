Donna Kim, 2 stars ,"Staff needs training—had a terrible experience with a server. If you are social profiling/stereotyping, be a little more discreet and cut down on your condescending tone please.

Overall wasn’t thrilled about the food either. Heavy on bechamel sauce and fat, which could serve some old school folks’ palates I suppose.",a day ago
Alex Graham, 5 stars ,"Had the food and wine pairing. Pretty much every item I had was the best I’ve ever had. Except the wagyu, I’ve had much better wagyu and the lamb here is better than the wagyu. The wines were all amazingly well paired with the food. An unforgettable experience for sure.",4 days ago
Rob Francis, 2 stars ,"Really nice staff (2 stars), but we left disappointed in the food and overall experience.  I’m not sure how Michelin assigns its stars anymore because this restaurant is a complete miss across the board - not a single memorable dish.  Their “Evolution” menu and a cheap bottle of wine were over $2k for 2 people.  Far better food experiences across NYC; I’d skip Per Se until they make some serious changes.",5 days ago

Haokun Liu, 2 stars ,"We made reservations for the dinner and due to emergent reasons, we asked if we can reschedule or refund, they refused. we then step back and ask we can voluntarily shorten our eating time by postponing the dinner by 1 hour. they refused. We finally asked can we get the food and eat at home so that it would not influence other customers experience , they refused. no matter what we propose, they refused to negotiate. we are customers and should not be treated by this attitude. If every circumstance is not allowed,  they shouldn’t required full amount deposit at the beginning.",3 weeks ago
Alisto Alio, 5 stars ,"Per Se is my favourite restaurant in the world ex aequo with Carlo Cracco restaurant in Milan. Location is wonderful. Service excellent. Menu outstanding. Someone can think prices are too high for a dinner. This is a mistake. Prices are fair for such a menu of masterworks. At least once in the entire life, everyone should go for dinner at Per Se.",3 weeks ago

Marina Pruni, 1 star ,"So bloated and little flexibility
2 tasting menus but one excludes the other, so, as in my case, if I don't like most of one, you can't mix
So given the prices (whoever invited us spent 3000 dollars for 4 people) I found this intransigence excessive and rude
It was also cold and windy",a month ago

Anthony R, 5 stars ,"Per Se is one of the finest dining experiences that you can have in NYC. I've eaten here four or five times over the years, the tasting menu is expensive but the experience is two plus hours long which is perfect for a special occasion. The food presentation is unique & outstanding. On a side note, I really miss his other NYC restaurant, the TAK room, which was located down in Hudson Yards. Unfortunately, covid put it out of business, but I really hope Mr. Keller brings the TAK room back one day. It was my favorite restaurant in NYC.",a month ago

Justine Mogren, 5 stars ,"Exquisite dishes!  Food was presented and plated beautifully! The ambiance was cozy but it could be better! The service was good but it can also be better! Been to one Michelin and two Michelin restaurants and the service is so much more welcoming and attentive! The wine and champagne selections are good depending too. We love every single dish they’ve served! Oysters and Pearls, Fillet Atlantic Bass, Avian Poulard and Calotte de Boeuf and if you have a sweet tooth you won’t be disappointed! Over all it’s a wonderful experience!",a month ago
Priya Patel, 1 star ,"Review is not about food but service. We had a dinner reservation and day before my husband tested positive for covid. I called the restaurant to see if they would let us transfer our reservation or cancel it but was refused. I even offered to share a doctors note and they did not care.
For such a upscale restaurant to not have any covid policy especially when calling more than 24 hours in advance is just wrong considering the world we live in. I was not even trying to get my deposit back, only asking if they would let us come at a later date. Basically the lady I spoke to said nothing she could do as outside of 72 hours. I told her don’t they care about their guest safety as she was implying he can still come to dinner with covid if didn’t want to lose the $400 deposit and all she said was, “sorry, I cannot advise you on that but we have a strict 72 hour cancellation policy”.",a month ago
Yunus Emre Tortamis, 5 stars ,"There are many good reasons these places get 3 michelin stars, and I experienced all of them in my visit.

From the service to the meal, everything  was par excellence. I have a very picky taste, especially in desserts, which I usually do not eat after the main course. Yet I enjoyed every bit of it without slightest disturbance. I left the place full but not overwhelmed, with a lot of photos and kind reception.",a month ago
Estelle Meyer, 5 stars ,"We were for the 60 birthday of my father we where around 10 people we had a great table and a very nice and gentle experience , the service was great the food was pretty classic but extremely good and tasty , it was a great dinner and will be a great memory .",2 months ago
Giuseppe Paglia, 5 stars ,"Final with a bang!

The last leg of our magnificent stay in New York.
Magnificent place with a view of the Columbus Circle square, at dinner and with a full moon rising just behind the skyscrapers, what else to expect ´SPECTACLE'.
The room is beautiful, completely soundproofed and with soft tones.
The service is undoubtedly impeccable worthy of a three star rating.
The courses eight in total that follow one another with great balance and freshness.
Final with a bang: dessert, they never end.
Thanks to all the staff!
Special thanks to Benny and our sommelier Sarah. Quintarelli 2015 ❤️

Claes Mogren, 4 stars ,"Probably the best tasting food we've had in all of USA. Definitely better than Alinea, but not as good as Frantzén in Stockholm or Alto in Milan. Definitely appreciated the gift bag with treats for the day after. The matching wine tasting is very expensive, I wish there was a slightly less pricey option since it isn't that many courses.",2 months ago

Chunglin Wen, 4 stars ,"Overall a great experience. Service and ambiance are what to expect for restaurants of this caliber. Somehow I was expecting a bit more for the cuisine per se. It lacks a little bit of magic and harmony compared to other fine dining places I’ve been to in NYC. Not a total lack of, of course, but I was hoping an even higher level of excellence.

Many dishes, while good, can leave some room to be nitpicked. For instance, I find the smell of the oyster in the highly famed “oyster and pearls” a bit too salient and slightly incompatible with the rest of the dish.

Dress code has been relaxed. While some patrons dress nicely, some dress in a fairly casual way. I would prefer they maintain a higher standard in this regard.

To end in a good point, I like the way they price. Service and soft drinks seem to be included. And the coffee is good even for a fine dining restaurant.

Overall definitely worth a visit at least once for a foodie. I’m just unsure how frequent I might visit, if I would dine here again.",2 months ago
Zoe Nelson Morris, 5 stars ,"I've been to several fine dining, tasting menu restaurants and Per Se ranked among the best. One stand out was the ability for my guest and I to select different dishes from one another throughout the tasting - I could have chicken one way, he another. The food was perfectly cooked. My favorite dish was the simplest: buttered noodles with truffles. Dessert covered the entire table. An all around fantastic meal. I had to contact the restaurant before and after the meal and the hospitality was incredibly patient and gracious. A perfect way to celebrate a special birthday (11/2021). My only suggestion to the team is to update the furnishings and decor - it would help make the room feel more intimate.",2 months ago

Ayako Yasuda, 5 stars ,"Thomas Keller's Michelin ✨ three-star restaurant. Sometime in Napa's French Laundry as well. The signature oysters and pearls looked and tasted better than I imagined.
The slow cooked lamb was also excellent.

The service person who was in charge of the beverage was studying Japanese, so we had a lively conversation.
For wine, I chose Kistler and Henri Jayer.
The hospitality was great from start to finish. Thank you for showing me the kitchen.
I would like to ask you again",2 months ago

Christine Xie, 5 stars ,"The food is amazing and the service is fantastic!

My son received his first fencing medal, and we celebrated here. Everyone congratulated him, including the chief, who served him extra dessert. As a special treat, we visited the kitchen. My son told me we had to go back to this restaurant afterward because it is so great! lol",3 months ago
Rio Ferreira, 5 stars ,"Really an outrageous restaurant, some of the best service in NYC and a wonderful atmosphere. The tasting menu is beautifully executed and they really do give an impressive amount of food throughout your experience. The one downside we came across was that our lobster course was slightly overcooked/tough. Other than that, an absolutely wonderful experience and a must go to for any occasion.",3 months ago
jamlick mutegi, 5 stars ,"I could not wish for a better celebration of my birthday. The experience fully lived up to the expectation in smallest detail. From the food which was a divinely crafted composition, through wine pairing, that elevated the experience even further, to the service that was just perfect. I felt grateful to be alive and able to enjoy the moment I will truly never forget. Thank you",3 months ago
