Derek Power, 5 stars ,"We tried Angels fior the first time this week having had positive feedback since moving to Longridge. The 5 course menu was excellent from start to finish with innovative dishes.
Just how do they get the malted ice cream to taste like velvet!
Wine choice very good also.
Not your steak and kidney pudding and chips place (as great as thar is) this is something different and nice for a special treat.
Each course was small to medium size but after 5 courses we were nicely full.",a month ago

John Lancaster, 3 stars ,"Visited with two friends from Cheshire for Sunday lunch. The restaurant was very formal with little character or atmosphere and unwelcoming staff - perhaps because we weren't regulars. The menu was nothing out of the ordinary - food which can be found at many other places and expensive for what it was. It had been recommended to us so we were all very disappointed. I think we'll stick with the inns and restaurants in the Cheshire countryside.
I have rated it 3 stars because food was well cooked and plentiful.",a year ago

biffta1978, 5 stars ,"We had a meet up with some friends that had just got engaged and we where not disappointed at all with angels . Plenty of parking for starters then into a plush modern lounge with very smart and interesting furniture and lovely decor  . The staff were very pleasant and on the ball in both welcoming us and service .
Tables where set out nicely and everything was pristine.
The food was excellent ,well cooked, seasoned ,descent portions and very good quality. Food of this standard is getting hard to find.
The service from front of house was great and flowed fast and efficiently. Good to see younger people who had obviously been trained correctly doing a great job. We also liked the the menu txt message to put our order in before we arrived. Great place and venue !.",a year ago

Emily Jenkins, 5 stars ,"Had a fantastic family meal at Angels last night based on recommendations while we were visiting the area. Every course was absolutely amazing, and the vegetarian options were as fantastic as the meat and fish options. Great selection of cocktails in the bar area, all a nice change from your average selection. The waiters and waitresses were very professional especially considering how young they were - they had clearly had excellent training and knew exactly what they were doing. The restaurant has a lovely atmosphere and the decor creates a luxurious but very welcoming place. Overall a lovely evening out and a real treat!",a year ago
